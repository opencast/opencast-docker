# Introduction

This repository holds `Dockerfiles` for creating [Opencast](http://www.opencast.org/) Docker images.

# Installation

All images are available on [Quay](https://quay.io/organization/opencast). To install the image simply pull the distribution you want:

```sh
$ docker pull "quay.io/opencast/<distribution>"
```

To install a specific version, use the following command:

```sh
$ docker pull "quay.io/opencast/<distribution>:<version>"
```

# Build

If you want to build the images yourself, there is a `Makefile` with the necessary `docker build` commands for all distributions. Running `make` in the root directory will create these images. To customize the build you can override these variables:

-   `DOCKER_IMAGE_BASE`<br>
    The fist part of the image name. It defaults to `opencast` and will be extended by the name of the Opencast distribution.
-   `DOCKER_TAG`<br>
    The tag of the image. Defaults to the content of `VERSION`.
-   `REPO`<br>
    The git repository to clone Opencast from. The default is the upstream repository, but you can use your own fork.
-   `BRANCH`<br>
    The name of the git branch to check out. Defaults to the value of `DOCKER_TAG`.
-   `CUSTOM_DOCKER_BUILD_ARGS`<br>
    Custom arguments that should be passed to `docker build`, e.g. you can set this to `--no-cache` to force an image build. By default empty.

# Quick Start

A quick local test system can be started using [`docker-compose`](https://github.com/docker/compose). After cloning this repository you can run this command from the root directory:

```sh
$ docker-compose -p opencast-allinone -f docker-compose/docker-compose.allinone.h2.yml up
```

This will run Opencast using the `allinone` distribution configured to use the bundled [H2 Database Engine](http://www.h2database.com/html/main.html).

In the `./docker-compose` directory there are also compose files for more production-like setups. `docker-compose.allinone.mariadb.yml` uses a MySQL database instead of H2, while `docker-compose.multiserver.mariadb.yml` demonstrates how to connect the different distributions. Replace the compose file in the command above if you want to use them instead. You can find more information about the compose files [here](docker-compose/README.md).

# Images

Opencast comes in different distributions. For each of the official distributions there is a specific Docker image. Each version is tagged. For example the full image name containing the `admin` distribution at version `8.5` is `quay.io/opencast/admin:8.5`. Leaving the version out will install the latest one.

## `allinone`

This image contains all Opencast modules necessary to run a full Opencast installation. It's useful for small and local test setups. If you however want to run Opencast in a distributed fashion, you probably should use a combination of `admin`, `worker` and `presentation` containers.

## `admin`, `adminpresentation`, `ingest`, `presentation` and `worker`,

These images contain the Opencast modules of the corresponding Opencast distributions.

## `build`

This images helps you set up a development environment for Opencast. For more information see [here](Dockerfiles/build/README.md).

# Usage

The images come with multiple commands. You can see a full list with description by running:

```sh
$ docker run --rm quay.io/opencast/<distribution> app:help
Usage:
  app:help                Prints the usage information
  app:print:ddl           Prints SQL commands to set up the database
  app:print:activemq.xml  Prints the configuration for ActiveMQ
  app:init                Checks and configures Opencast but does not run it
  app:start               Starts Opencast
  [cmd] [args...]         Runs [cmd] with given arguments
```

# Configuration

It's recommended to configure Opencast by using [Docker Volumes](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#volume-shared-filesystems):

```sh
$ docker run -v "/path/to/opencast-etc:/etc/opencast" quay.io/opencast/<distribution>
```

The most important settings, however, can be configured by [environment variables](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#env-environment-variables). You can use this functionally to generate new configuration files. For this start a new container with specific variables and execute the `app:init` command. This will ensure you haven't missed anything, write the configuration files and exit. Then you can copy the files to a target directory:

```sh
$ docker run --name opencast_generate_config \
  -e "ACTIVEMQ_BROKER_URL=failover://tcp://example.opencast.org:61616" \
  -e "ACTIVEMQ_BROKER_USERNAME=admin" \
  -e "ACTIVEMQ_BROKER_PASSWORD=password" \
  -e "ORG_OPENCASTPROJECT_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:8080" \
  -e "ORG_OPENCASTPROJECT_SECURITY_ADMIN_USER=admin" \
  -e "ORG_OPENCASTPROJECT_SECURITY_ADMIN_PASS=opencast" \
  -e "ORG_OPENCASTPROJECT_SECURITY_DIGEST_USER=opencast_system_account" \
  -e "ORG_OPENCASTPROJECT_SECURITY_DIGEST_PASS=CHANGE_ME" \
  quay.io/opencast/<distribution> "app:init"
$ docker cp opencast_generate_config:/opencast/etc opencast-config
$ docker rm opencast_generate_config
```

Make sure to use the correct Opencast distribution as there are small differences.

## Opencast

-   `ORG_OPENCASTPROJECT_SERVER_URL` Optional<br>
    The HTTP-URL where Opencast is accessible. The default is `http://<Fully Qualified Host Name>:8080`.
-   `ORG_OPENCASTPROJECT_SECURITY_ADMIN_USER` **Required**<br>
    Username of the admin user.
-   `ORG_OPENCASTPROJECT_SECURITY_ADMIN_PASS` **Required**<br>
    Password of the admin user. You may alternatively set `ORG_OPENCASTPROJECT_SECURITY_ADMIN_PASS_FILE` to the location of a file within the container that contains the password.
-   `ORG_OPENCASTPROJECT_SECURITY_DIGEST_USER` **Required**<br>
    Username for the communication between Opencast nodes and capture agents.
-   `ORG_OPENCASTPROJECT_SECURITY_DIGEST_PASS` **Required**<br>

-   `ORG_OPENCASTPROJECT_DOWNLOAD_URL` Optional<br>
    The HTTP-URL to use for downloading media files, e.g. for the player. Defaults to `${org.opencastproject.server.url}/static`.
-   `ORG_OPENCASTPROJECT_ADMIN_EMAIL` Optional<br>
    Email address of the server's admin. Defaults to `admin@localhost`.

For an installation with multiple nodes you can also set:

-   `PROP_ORG_OPENCASTPROJECT_FILE_REPO_URL` Optional<br>
    HTTP-URL of the file repository. Defaults to `${org.opencastproject.server.url}` in the `allinone` distribution and `${org.opencastproject.admin.ui.url}` for every other one.
-   `PROP_ORG_OPENCASTPROJECT_ADMIN_UI_URL` **Required for all but `allinone`**<br>
    HTTP-URL of the admin node.
-   `PROP_ORG_OPENCASTPROJECT_ENGAGE_UI_URL` **Required for all but `allinone`**<br>
    HTTP-URL of the engage node.

## ActiveMQ

-   `ACTIVEMQ_BROKER_URL` **Required**<br>
    URL to ActiveMQ instances using the format specified in the [Opencast documentation](https://docs.opencast.org/latest/admin/configuration/message-broker/), e.g. `failover://tcp://example.opencast.org:61616`
-   `ACTIVEMQ_BROKER_USERNAME` **Required**<br>
    ActiveMQ username.
-   `ACTIVEMQ_BROKER_PASSWORD` **Required**<br>
    Password of the ActiveMQ user. You may alternatively set `ACTIVEMQ_BROKER_PASSWORD_FILE` to the location of a file within the container that contains the password.

## Database

-   `ORG_OPENCASTPROJECT_DB_VENDOR` Optional<br>
    The type of database to use. Currently you can set this to either `H2` or `MySQL`. The default is `H2`.
-   `ORG_OPENCASTPROJECT_DB_DDL_GENERATION` Optional<br>
    Specifies whether Opencast should create the database tables or not. It defaults to `false`. In case of `H2` it is always set to `true`.
-   `NUMER_OF_TIMES_TRYING_TO_CONNECT_TO_DB` Optional<br>
    Specifies how often Opencast is going to try to connect to the specified database before giving up. The waiting time between tries is 5 seconds. The default number of tries is 25. This configuration only applies if the database is not H2.

### H2

There are no additional environment variables you can set if you are using the H2 database.

### MySQL

-   `ORG_OPENCASTPROJECT_DB_JDBC_URL` **Required**<br>
    [JDBC](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/jdbc/index.html) connection string.

## Miscellaneous

-   `TIMEZONE` Optional<br>
    Set the timezone within the container. Valid timezones are represented by files in `/usr/share/zoneinfo/`, for example `Europe/Berlin`. The default is `UTC`.

# Data

The data directory is located at `/data`. Use [Docker Volumes](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#volume-shared-filesystems) to mount this directory on your host.

# Languages

Opencast makes use of [Tesseract](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract) to recognize text in videos (ORC) and [Hunspell](https://hunspell.github.io/) to identify spelling mistakes. Both need additional files namely [traningsdata](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tessdata) and [dictionaries](http://download.services.openoffice.org/contrib/dictionaries) respectively. These images come with files for the English language. If you need other or more languages you can use Docker Volumes to mount them in the appropriate directories `/usr/share/tessdata` and `/usr/share/hunspell`.
